## :grey_question: What is it?
* I wanted to look at the Onyomi and Kunyomi readings of the most frequently used Kanji.
* So I combined a couple of dataframes and looked at the most common POSSIBLE readings of the most commonly used Kanji.
* I wanted to weight the Kanji by frequency, as shown here: https://github.com/LexingtonWhalen/KanjiStrokesAnalysis

## :zap: Features:
* Analyzes the possible readings of the most frequently used kanji!
* Creates graphs and dataframes!

## :package: Modules / Packages:
* numpy: https://numpy.org/devdocs/index.html
* pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#
* re:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
* matplotlib:https://matplotlib.org/
* random:https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

###### :hammer: To do:
* Try to find a better way of classifying the most frequent readings by the readings of the Kanji of those most common words, rather than just the possible readings.
